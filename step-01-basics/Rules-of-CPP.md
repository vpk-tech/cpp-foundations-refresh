Rules of CPLUSPLUS

Change code → compile ;
Compile fails → fix ;
Compile succeeds → run

"I changed the code but output didn’t change" -> you didn't recompile the code

_Mental Model_

Compiler = rule enforcer + translator ;
Executable = frozen snapshot of your code ;
Running ≠ compiling ;
Debugger = time control for your program
